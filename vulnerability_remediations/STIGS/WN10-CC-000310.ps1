.SYNOPSIS
    Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack. 
    The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the servers WINS resolution capability.

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
# STIG ID: WN10-CC-000310
# Purpose: Prevent users from changing Windows Installer options (enforces centralized installation control)

$path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer"

Write-Output "Checking compliance for STIG ID: WN10-CC-000310 ..."

# --- 1. Ensure registry path exists ---
if (-not (Test-Path $path)) {
    New-Item -Path $path -Force | Out-Null
    Write-Output "Created missing registry path: $path"
}

# --- 2. Retrieve current registry value (if any) ---
$currentValue = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name $name -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).$name

# --- 3. Evaluate compliance ---
if ($currentValue -eq $desiredValue) {
    Write-Output "Compliant: $name is already set to $desiredValue (User control over Installer is disabled)"
}
else {
    # --- 4. Apply remediation ---
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name $name -Value $desiredValue -Type DWord

    if ($null -eq $currentValue) {
        Write-Output "Remediated: $name did not exist, created with value $desiredValue"
    }
    else {
        Write-Output "Remediated: $name was $currentValue, changed to $desiredValue"
    }
}

Write-Output "Verification complete for STIG ID: WN10-CC-000310"
