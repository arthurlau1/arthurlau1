# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
# STIG ID: WN10-CC-000355
# Purpose: Disable WinRM "RunAs" functionality to prevent credential delegation and privilege escalation

$path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Service"

# --- 1. Ensure registry path exists ---

    Write-Output "Created missing registry path: $path"
}

# --- 2. Retrieve current value (if it exists) ---
$currentValue = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name $name -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).$name

# --- 3. Check compliance ---
if ($currentValue -eq $desiredValue) {
    Write-Output "Compliant: $name is already set to $desiredValue (WinRM RunAs is disabled)"
}

    # --- 4. Remediate non-compliant systems ---
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name $name -Value $desiredValue -Type DWord

    if ($null -eq $currentValue) {
        Write-Output "Remediated: $name did not exist, created with value $desiredValue"
    } else {
        Write-Output "Remediated: $name was $currentValue, changed to $desiredValue"
    }
}

Write-Output "Verification complete for STIG ID: WN10-CC-000355"
