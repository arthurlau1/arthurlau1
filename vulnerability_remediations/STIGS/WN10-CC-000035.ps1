.SYNOPSIS
    Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack. 
    The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the servers WINS resolution capability.

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
# STIG ID: WN10-CC-000035
# Purpose: Prevent the system from releasing its NetBIOS name upon demand (protects against spoofing and DoS)

$path = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetBT\Parameters"
$name = "NoNameReleaseOnDemand"
$desiredValue = 1

# --- 1. Ensure the registry path exists ---
if (-not (Test-Path $path)) {
    New-Item -Path $path -Force | Out-Null
    Write-Output "Created registry path: $path"
}

# --- 2. Retrieve current value if it exists ---
$currentValue = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name $name -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).$name

# --- 3. Check compliance ---
if ($currentValue -eq $desiredValue) {
    Write-Output "Compliant: $name is already set to $desiredValue (NetBIOS name release on demand is disabled)"
}
else {
    # --- 4. Remediate the setting ---
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name $name -Value $desiredValue -Type DWord
    if ($null -eq $currentValue) {
        Write-Output "Remediated: $name did not exist, created with value $desiredValue"
    } else {
        Write-Output "Remediated: $name was $currentValue, changed to $desiredValue"
    }
}

Write-Output "Verification complete for STIG ID: WN10-CC-000035"
