.SYNOPSIS
    Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. 
    Limiting this capability will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise. 
    The "Security" option for Telemetry configures the lowest amount of data, effectively none outside of the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), Defender, and telemetry client settings. 
    "Basic" sends basic diagnostic and usage data and may be required to support some Microsoft services. 
    "Enhanced" includes additional information on how Windows and apps are used and advanced reliability data. 
    Windows Analytics can use a "limited enhanced" level to provide information such as health data for devices. 
    This requires the configuration of an additional setting available with v1709 and later of Windows 10.

    Example syntax:
     
#>

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
$path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection"
$name = "AllowTelemetry"

# Allowed compliant values: 0 (Security), 1 (Basic), or 2 (Enhanced if Windows Analytics is used)
$allowedValues = @(0, 1, 2)

# Default desired value (use 1 if unsure)
$desiredValue = 1

# Ensure registry path exists
if (-not (Test-Path $path)) {
    New-Item -Path $path -Force | Out-Null
    Write-Output "Created registry path: $path"
}

# Get current value if exists
$currentValue = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name $name -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).$name

# Check compliance
if ($allowedValues -contains $currentValue) {
    switch ($currentValue) {
        0 { Write-Output "Compliant: AllowTelemetry is set to 0 (Security)" }
        1 { Write-Output "Compliant: AllowTelemetry is set to 1 (Basic)" }
        2 { Write-Output "Compliant: AllowTelemetry is set to 2 (Enhanced) â€“ ensure Windows Analytics justification (V-220833)" }
    }
}
else {
    Write-Output "Non-Compliant: AllowTelemetry is set to $currentValue (should be 0, 1, or 2 depending on policy)"
    Write-Output "Remediating to $desiredValue (Basic)..."

    # Apply remediation
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name $name -Value $desiredValue -Type DWord

    if ($null -eq $currentValue) {
        Write-Output "Remediated: $name did not exist, created with value $desiredValue"
    } else {
        Write-Output "Remediated: $name was $currentValue, changed to $desiredValue"
    }
}
